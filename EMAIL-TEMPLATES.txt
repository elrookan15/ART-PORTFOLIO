SUBJECT LINE:
A quick note from the studio / Welcome to the collection

FROM: [Your Name] <your-email@domain.com>

BODY:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for joining my journey.

I'm a self-taught artist who believes that a canvas is just a 
conversation waiting to happen. Because I didn't come from a 
traditional art background, I don't paint to follow a 
curriculum—I paint to tell stories.

The most exciting part of my work isn't when I finish a piece; 
it's when someone like you looks at it and sees a story I never 
even imagined. To me, that's when the art actually becomes "real."

I'll be using this space to share:

• First looks at new pieces from my latest collections.
• Behind-the-scenes glimpses into my (sometimes messy) process.
• Early access to sales and local show announcements.

I'm glad to have you in the gallery. If you ever see a piece 
that speaks to you, I'd love to hear what story it's telling 
you today.

Best,

[Your Name]

personally.

EMAIL 2: FIRST PURCHASE CONFIRMATION (After Sale)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SUBJECT LINE:
Your artwork is on its way / Thank you for collecting my work

FROM: [Your Name] <your-email@domain.com>

BODY:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Hi [Name],

I can't thank you enough for choosing "[ARTWORK TITLE]" for 
your collection.

As a self-taught artist, every piece I create carries a piece 
of my journey—the experiments, the failures, the moments when 
the paint decided to go its own direction (and I let it). When 
someone connects with that energy, it means more than I can 
put into words.

What you're receiving:
• "[ARTWORK TITLE]" - [DIMENSIONS], [YEAR]
• Signed and dated on the back
• Certificate of Authenticity (attached)
• Care instructions for acrylic works

I've packaged it with care, and it's on its way to you. 
Tracking info: [TRACKING LINK]

Once it arrives, I'd love to see how it looks in your space. 
Feel free to tag me on Instagram (@yourhandle) or send me a 
photo—I always love seeing where my work ends up living.

If you have any questions about the piece or how to display it, 
I'm just an email away.

Thank you for supporting an independent artist.

Best,

[Your Name]

EMAIL 3: VIEWING ROOM ACCESS GRANTED

FROM: [Your Name] <your-email@domain.com>

BODY:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in my work. I'm opening up my private 
viewing room for you.

This is where I keep a curated selection of available works, 
complete with pricing and detailed information. It's the first 
place I share new pieces before they go public.

ACCESS DETAILS:
URL: https://elrookan15.github.io/ART-PORTFOLIO/#viewing-room
Password: [CUSTOM PASSWORD]

You'll see pieces from all three of my series:
• Interference Code (the structured, grid-based works)
• Neon Noir (high-contrast splatters on dark backgrounds)
• Full Spectrum Static (dense, all-over compositions)

If something speaks to you, just hit "Inquire" and I'll follow 
up with details on shipping, framing options, and anything else 
you'd like to know.

Thanks for taking the time to look.

Best,

[Your Name]

💡 "OUTSIDER BRANDING" TALKING POINT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When people ask: "Where did you study art?"

YOUR RESPONSE:
"I didn't go to art school—I'm a developer by trade. I spend 
my days building structures in code, so when I get to the 
canvas, I love the freedom of creating structures that are 
purely emotional and abstract. No rules, just process."

WHY THIS WORKS:
✓ Makes you memorable
✓ Authentic and honest
✓ Explains your "digital glitch" aesthetic
✓ Positions coding as complementary skill
✓ "Outsider artist" has market appeal
✓ Shows intentionality (not hobbyist)


ALTERNATIVE VERSION (More Casual):
"I'm self-taught. My background is in tech and coding, which 
probably explains why my paintings look like corrupted code 
and digital interference. When you're not constrained by 
tradition, you can experiment more freely."
